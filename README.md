# Solving N-Queen's Problem using Simulated Annealing and Backtracking Algorithm
## What is the N-Queen's Problem?
N-Queen's problem is an effort to find a placement of N Queens on an N by N chess board so that no two queens attack each other (neither at the same row, column, nor diagonal).
There's an example solution of N-Queen's problem when N=4

## Goals of Proposed Algorithm
The proposed algorithm are used to reducing time processing. Backtracking algorithm help simmulated annealing to find the best initial solution. Therefore the best solution can be find faster.
Here are the result of this method:
